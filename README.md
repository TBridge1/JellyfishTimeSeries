This dissertation investigates the fluctuations in jellyfish populations around the coast of Ireland and the UK from the period 2002 to 2023, with a focus on understanding whether human factors like climate change are a cause.

Over the past two decades, jellyfish blooms or large population spikes have garnered increased attention due to their impact on ecosystems and economies.

Varying studies attribute these changes to rising sea levels and increased temperatures while others have argued that jellyfish populations are volatile and fluctuate wildly as part of their natural life cycle.

This dissertation tackles the problem from both the statistical time series side but also incorporates deep learning techniques to examine the trends and oscillations in jellyfish populations.

The dissertation begins with a focus on the statistical time series approach where tested methods like Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and its offshoots like Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenus factors (SARIMAX) are explored.

Various techniques to improve these models were explored including autocorrelation, differencing and time series split.

The results from this varied but suggested an overall increase in the next few years while maintaining an oscillating pattern.

Deep learning approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers were investigated and had the potential to extract greater understanding from the data by capturing longer-term dependencies. 

These approaches again varied in results but overall, also suggested an increase in the oscillating pattern for the next few years. 

The findings as stated were often contradictory and varied mirroring the complexity of jellyfish populations but overall, they agreed that their populations face a natural cycle, but the highs are going to continue to increase likely due to human and climate-related influences.

This dissertation explores the importance of taking multiple approaches to investigate a complex problem as no single model revealed a definitive answer and by extracting parts from multiple sources a solution to the problem becomes clearer. While insights in this dissertation are interesting, they mostly serve as a stepping stone for further research in the future with more complex models and access to better data which could assist in solutions to tackling this complex problem.
